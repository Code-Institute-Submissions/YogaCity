## Deployment
I started working on this project in Repl.it because I worked on it from different devices.
Every time I was on my own laptop I copied everything to GitPod and pushed it to GitHub.
Like this I also always had an extra backup, when needed.
<br>
This website starts with the: index.html, followed by the map ‘assets’, with a map of ‘images’ and a map of ‘css’.
In the ’css’ map you will find the page: style.css.
A map called 'mockups' with small, medium and large wireframes.
A map called 'screenshots' with an image of the used colors and a demo.gif.
Ending with the README.md.
